	<p style="font-family: Courier New;Font-size:30px; color: black "> What Are Cherry Blossoms?</p>

	<p style="font-family:DaunPenh;Font-size:25px; color: black "> Cherry blossoms are flowers from the genus Prunus trees. Each spring, these dainty blossoms bloom in hues of white and pink in Japan; Washington, D.C.; Macon, Georgia; and various countries around the world, including Canada, France, Australia, Brazil, Spain, Germany, and Turkey. </p>
	<p style="font-family:DaunPenh;Font-size:25px; color: black ">While cherry blossoms technically grow on cherry trees, varieties grown for their edible fruit tend to have less showy flowers, and those grown for spectacular blooms tend not to bear edible fruit.</p>

	<p style="font-family: Imprint MT Shadow;Font-size:30px; color: black "> What Do Cherry Blossoms Symbolize? </p>

	<p style="font-family:Arabic Typesetting;Font-size:25px; color: black "> Since cherry blossoms are one of the shortest-lived flowers – only blooming for a couple of weeks each year – they represent renewal and the fleeting nature of life in Japan. Due to the bloom’s extreme popularity in Japan, this is one of the most widely accepted meanings of cherry blossoms, but it’s not the only one. </p>
	<p style="font-family:Arabic Typesetting;Font-size:25px; color: black "> In China, cherry blossoms are linked to sexuality and the beauty of women and are sometimes associated with women’s ability to dominate using their appearance. </p>
	<p style="font-family:Arabic Typesetting;Font-size:25px; color: black "> Although cherry blossom festivals are controversial in South Korea due to tense relations with Japan, the flower is considered a symbol of purity and beauty in the country. </p>
	<p style="font-family:Arabic Typesetting;Font-size:25px; color: black "> Beyond each culture’s unique symbolism for the blooms, cherry blossoms generally represent rebirth, renewal, new beginnings, and the start of spring.</p>

	<p style="font-family: Magneto;Font-size:30px; color: black "> Significance of Cherry Blossoms in Japan</p>

	<p style="font-family:Arabic Typesetting;Font-size:25px; color: black ">Nobody personifies the metaphor of cherry blossoms embodying beauty and mortality more than the samurai.</p>
	<p style="font-family:Arabic Typesetting;Font-size:25px; color: black "> These warriors lived by a strict moral code of honor, respect, and discipline called bushido – the way of the warrior. Their duty was to embody these virtues while appreciating the inevitability of death without fearing it. It was believed that a fallen cherry blossom symbolized the end of their short lives.</p>
	<p style="font-family:Arabic Typesetting;Font-size:25px; color: black ">Japanese pilots in World War II embraced a similar meaning of cherry blossoms when they painted their kamikaze planes with the blooms before going on suicide missions to “die like beautiful falling cherry petals for the emperor.” </p>
	<p style="font-family:Arabic Typesetting;Font-size:25px; color: black ">While cherry blossoms are no longer embraced for self-destructive or military purposes, their philosophical and aesthetic value remains. Sakura retains its symbolism as a new beginning in Japan since its blooming coincides with the start of the new fiscal year each April, when children go back to school and employees often start new jobs. </p>


	<p style="font-family:Kristen ITC;Font-size:30px; color: black "> The Ritual of Hanami </p>

	<p style="font-family:Arabic Typesetting;Font-size:25px; color: black ">  Hanami – meaning “flower viewing” in Japanese – is a traditional custom dating back to the 8th century involving enjoying cherry blossoms’ (or other flowers’) beauty. Whether you sit alone under a cherry blossom tree and enjoy your favorite drink or you gather with dozens of your friends and family, hanami is a time to reflect on how lovely and short life really is.</p>
	<p style="font-family:Arabic Typesetting;Font-size:25px; color: black ">At night, hanami transforms into yozakura – “cherry blossoms at night” – a romantic way for couples to appreciate the blooms, often by lantern light.</p>
